# ImmosquareYaml

ImmosquareYaml is a dedicated Ruby gem crafted to parse, dump, manage, and translate YML translation files with finesse. 

In the past, there have been significant challenges in using existing YAML parsers like [Psych](https://github.com/ruby/psych) and [YAML](https://github.com/ruby/yaml) (which internally utilizes Psych). Issues arose, such as interpreting translation keys like `yes:`, `no:`, and others as booleans. Additionally, they showed shortcomings in effectively handling multiline texts, often faltering with notations like `key: |`, `key: |-`, `key: >`, `key: |5+`, `key: |3-`, and more.

### Why Choose ImmosquareYaml?
Here are some standout features and advantages of this gem:

- **Reserved Key Management**: Handles keys with "reserved" words seamlessly.
- **Complete Multiline Handling**: Efficiently processes multiline texts using various notations.
- **Value Uniformization**: Retains double quotes only when essential, ensuring a clean and readable output.
- **Emoji Handling**: Comprehensive management of emojis in YAML files.
- **Sorting Capability**: Offers sorting (enabled by default) during the cleaning or parsing phase for a structured representation.
- **Automatic Translations**: Features an automatic translation of YML files, leveraging the artificial intelligence of OpenAI.
- **Optimized for Translations**: Precisely tailored for handling translation files, addressing challenges faced with other parsers.

Whether you're managing translations, real estate data, or any other form of YML data, ImmosquareYaml offers a refined, efficient, and user-friendly experience. Dive in and simplify your YAML operations!

## Quick Example

Let's assume you have a YML file with some reserved keys, multiline texts, and emojis:

````YML
en:
  demo: "demo" 
  yes: "This is not a boolean"
  no: "Neither is this"
  emoji: "Here's an emoji1: \U0001F600"
  emoji2: "Here's an emoji2 \U0001F600"
  demo2:
    demo2-1:
      demo2-1-1: "hello"
      demo2-1-2:
      demo2-1-3: "John Doe"
  demo3:
    1: "task #1"
    2: "task #2"
    3: "task #2"
  demo4:
    "1": "task #1"
    "2": "task #2"
    "3": "task #2"
  some_special_characters:
    special1: "-hyphen"
    special2: "*asterisk"
    special3: "%percent"
    special4: ",comma"
    special5: "!exclamation"
    special6: "?question_mark"
    special7: "&ampersand"
    special8: "#hash"
    special9: "@at"
  some_special_characters:
    special1: """-tiret"""
    special2: """*astÃ©risque"""
    special3: """%pourcent"""
    special4: """,virgule"""
    special5: """!point_d'exclamation"""
    special6: """?point_d'interrogation"""
    special7: """&esperluette"""
    special8: """#croisillon"""
    special9: """@arobase"""
  description1: "This is the first line of test #1 \U0001F600.\nThis is the second line of test#1.\nThis is the third line of test.#1"
  description2: |
    This is the first line of test #2 \U0001F600.
    This is the second line of test #2.
    This is the third line of test #2.
  description3: |4-
      This is the first line of test #3 \U0001F600.
      This is the second line of test #3.
      This is the third line of test #3.
  description4: > 
    This is the first line of test #4 \U0001F600.
    This is the second line of test #4.
    This is the third line of test #4.  
````

After processing this YML file with `ImmosquareYaml.clean(path_to_file`, reserved keys such as yes and no are preserved, emojis are correctly interpreted, unnecessary quotes are removed, and multiline texts are formatted consistently.

      demo2-1-1: hello
      demo2-1-2: null

    "2": "task #2"

and you can have the automatically translated version avec la mÃ©thode `ImmosquareYaml::Translate.translate(path_to_file, "fr")`

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'immosquare-yaml'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install immosquare-yaml
```

## Usage

### Parsing YAML Files

To parse a YAML file and transform it into a Ruby hash, use the `ImmosquareYaml.parse` method:

```ruby
hash = ImmosquareYaml.parse('path/to/your/file.yml')
```

By default, the resulting hash will be sorted. If you do not wish to sort the hash, pass the `:sort => false` option:

```ruby
hash = ImmosquareYaml.parse('path/to/your/file.yml', :sort => false)
```

### Cleaning YAML Files

To clean a YAML file, use the `ImmosquareYaml.clean` method:

```ruby
ImmosquareYaml.clean('path/to/your/file.yml')
```

As with the `parse` method, the file will be sorted by default after cleaning. If you do not wish to sort the file, pass the `:sort => false` option:

```ruby
ImmosquareYaml.clean('path/to/your/file.yml', :sort => false)
```

### Creating YAML Files

To create a YAML file from a Ruby hash, use the `ImmosquareYaml.dump` method:

```ruby
hash = { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 }
ImmosquareYaml.dump(hash, 'path/to/your/new/file.yml')
```


### Translate YAML Files

Leveraging the growing prowess of AI tools, ImmosquareYaml has branched out to encompass translation features. The translation module utilizes OpenAI's API to translate YML files.

#### Configuration

Before using the translation feature, ensure you've set up your OpenAI API key and have chosen the OpenAI model you'd like to use. We have to add a initilizer in your Rails App

```ruby
## Available models:
## https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/
## gpt-3.5-turbo
## gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
## gpt-4
## gpt-4-32k
ImmosquareYaml.config do |config|
  config.openai_api_key = ENV.fetch("openai_api_key", nil)
  config.openai_model   = "gpt-4"
end
```

### Translation

The primary method provided by the translation module is `translate`, which takes the file path, target locale, and other options to translate the YML file.

```ruby
ImmosquareYaml::Translate.translate('path/to/your/file.yml', 'fr')
```

### Rake Tasks

Two rake tasks have been included to ease YML file management in a Rails application:

1. **Cleaning**: Cleans translation files within your Rails application. To use this task:

```bash
rake immosquare_yaml:clean
```

2. **Translation**: Translates translation files within your Rails application. To use this task:

```bash
rake immosquare_yaml:translate SOURCE_LOCALE=fr
```
